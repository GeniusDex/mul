The MUL Utility Library is a header-only library of small utilities for modern C++. MUL contains the following utilities:

* `event` supports subscribing multiple event handlers to be called whenever the event fires
* `worker_thread` provides synchronous or asynchronous execution of functions on a dedicated thread
